# material advection calculator 
Calculate a numerical solution to the advection equation to simulate the movement of a cloud of material in the atmospheric boundary layer. This program is parallelised using OpenMP to improve performance and calculation speed.

## running the program
Edit parameters in `advection2D.c` if needed, then build the program using the following instructions. The program will generate 3 output files: `initial.dat`, `average.dat` and `final.dat`. 

### building `advection2D`
With terminal/command prompt, ensure that you are within the project directory where the `makefile` and `advection2D.c` files are located. Then enter the following command to build `advection2D`.

#### without openMP
```bash
make advection2D
```

#### with openMP enabled
```bash
make omp_advection2D
```

#### other make commands:
- `make clean`: removes all files generated by previous program runs, including `*.dat`, `.png` files and `advection2D` within the current directory.

### plotting graphs
To generate graphs using the given plotting scripts, ensure that gnuplot is installed on the device/virtual environment. Still within the working directory, run the following commands:

- To generate the **initial** graph of the cloud of material, run `gnuplot plot_initial`
- To generate the **final** graph of the cloud of material, run `gnuplot plot_final`

A script to generate the vertically average distribution of $u(x,y)$ is not provided in this repository, running the command `gnuplot`, then `plot 'average.dat'`
